My first repository

Hello world!
This is my first ever repository on Github. I am an amateur coder who has little to no experience coding real projects but hopefully all of that will change since I have successfully made a Github account. 
I like C++, Python and Data Analytics to name a few things. Hope to get a lot of experience and knowledge through this...
